Heart Clicker Deluxe

Heart Clicker Deluxe is a small incremental clicker game built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

Players click a heart to earn currency (“hearts”) and buy upgrades that increase passive heart generation.

Gameplay

Click the heart to earn hearts.

Buy upgrades that automatically generate hearts per second.

Upgrade prices increase by 15% after each purchase.

Total hearts and hearts-per-second are always visible.

Data-Driven Shop

All shop items come from one shopItems array.

No hard-coded per-item logic.

New items can be added by editing only the data, not the code.

Upgrades are created and updated using loops.

UI & Visual Design

Soft Hello Kitty pink theme.

Deep sakura blossom gradient background.

Circular glowing heart button with a click pulse animation.

Clean, centered shop card layout.

Each upgrade shows:

name

cost

production rate

"Owned" count

description

Global Quicksand font for a cute, modern aesthetic.
